Questions:

For the explanations, generally a sentence or two should be enough.
Type your answers directly in this file.


1.  Give tight big-theta bounds on the worst-case runtime of the
add and find functions in LinkedListDict.

    add:
        T(n) belongs to theta(1)
    find:
        T(n) belongs to theta(n)


2.  Run the 5x5 slider puzzle with HeapPriorityQueue and LinkedListDict.
What runtime do you get?  This is roughly the performance you had
for Project 1.

    ~40 seconds (consistent with proj1)
    

3.  Run the 5x5 slider puzzle with HeapPriorityQueue and your working
AVLDict, LinearHashDict, and DoubleHashDict classes.
What are your run times?  How do they compare to Q2?

    AVLDict: ~1 second
    LinearHashDict: ~1 second
    DoubleHashDict: ~1 second
    

They are obviously much faster than the LinkedListDict because these data structures have more efficient algorithms for finding MazeStates. 

For the remaining questions, we'll keep using HeapPriorityQueue,
but switch to the UNSOLVABLE 3x3 slider puzzle to have something
a bit more challenging for your program.  When we ask you for
the average depth or number of probes, treat the "More" row as
being equal to 29.

4.  What is your runtime using AVLDict?  Based on the statistics
printed out, what is the average depth of the find calls?

    ~5 seconds
    average depth of 16.74 probes
    

5.  What is your runtime using LinearHashDict?  Based on the statistics
printed out, what is the average number of probes for the find calls?

    ~2 seconds. 
    Average number of probes is 2.63.

6.  Change your LinearHashDict to use the notprimes array instead of the
primes array for the table size.  (See the example in the constructor,
and be sure to make the change every where in your program that you set
the tablesize.)  Now, what is your runtime using LinearHashDict?
And what is the average number of probes for the find calls?
(Be sure to change the code back to using primes before you handin
your code!)

    ~9 seconds
    Average number of probes is 12.29.

7.  What is your runtime using DoubleHashDict?  Based on the statistics
printed out, what is the average number of probes for the find calls?

    < 1 second
    Average number of probes is 1.97

8.  Change your DoubleHashDict to use the notprimes array instead of the
primes array for the table size.  What happens?  Why?

    The programm apparently runs forever. We terminated 
    it after 3 mins. 
    
    This is because it is probing infinitely and the hash
    dictionary fails to find an empty place, it keeps 
    searching the same places.

9.  Keeping your DoubleHashDict using notprimes, change to using hash3
instead of hash2 for the probing.  What is your runtime using DoubleHashDict?
What is the average number of probes for the find calls?
(Be sure to change the code back to using primes before you handin
your code!)

    < 1 second
    Average number of probes is 4.61.

10(Bonus).  For a very small bonus (but a lot of fun), try to explain
precisely why the chosen hash function (hash1 in the DoubleHashDict)
interacts so poorly with the notprimes table sizes.

    If the hash value is not prime, dividing by random numbers will yield a higher chance of collisions.

We will be checking your implementations of AVLDict, LinearHashDict,
and DoubleHashDict.
